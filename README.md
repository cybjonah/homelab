# Homelab

Welcome to my homelab â€” a hands-on digital playground and personal sandbox where I design, build, break, and secure systems for learning, testing, and improving real-world IT and cybersecurity skills.

This is a **living library** of my technical projects, self-hosted infrastructure, automation scripts, and a little bit of good old-fashioned tomfoolery.

## Purpose

My homelab serves as:
- A platform for **experimenting with new tools and technologies**
- A testbed for **cybersecurity frameworks**, SIEM/SOAR integrations, and network simulations
- A hands-on learning environment for **DevOps, virtualization, and automation**
- A place to document findings, failures, and lessons learned along the way
