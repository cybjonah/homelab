## Welcome to this mess

Today I'm going to be doing some expreimentation, it is currently 2pm on **7/11/2025** and I've been doing some research into SOAR platforms and I've stumbled upon n8n. I've already used n8n before but only in the cloud so in this project I'm going to be deploying n8n on prem, as well as wazuh and try and automate alerts being generated in wazuh to be automatically filtered via N8N, and use threat intell (possibily opencti) and other platforms like virus total, AbuseIPDB etc to validate if a alert is a true positive or not and action on it.

Wish me luck!
