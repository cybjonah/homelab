#  Vulnerability Tools

This section contains tools, labs, and configurations related to vulnerability assessment and scanning.

It includes:
- Open-source vulnerability scanners (e.g., OpenVAS, Trivy, Nmap NSE)
- Assessment setups (vulnerable Docker images, misconfigured services)
- Custom scripts for automation
- Sample scan results and comparisons

These tools are used to identify misconfigurations, outdated software, and exploitable weaknesses during the early phases of penetration testing.
