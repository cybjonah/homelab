## Inital Setup

First off I obviously need a machine to run this on, the machine of my choice is going to be *kail linux* version 2025.2.

These are the requirements for the VM, I'll be using the minimal recommendations for now, I found these on the Greenbone community documentation which will be linked at the end of this file.
